> **Zero model drift between AI agents.**
> Universal session continuity protocol and CLI for Claude, GPT, Gemini, and any LLM.

## The Problem

You switch from Claude to GPT mid-project. You open a new chat. You spend 20 minutes re-explaining your stack, your decisions, your constraints. Again. The AI confidently suggests something you already ruled out three sessions ago.

**Every AI session starts with amnesia. contextkeeper fixes this.**

It gives every project a structured state file — synced to GitHub — that any AI agent can read in under 60 seconds.

---

## Install
```bash
pip install contextkeeper
# or
npm install -g contextkeeper
```

---

## How It Works
contextkeeper init    →  generates STATE_VECTOR.json + HANDOFF.md
contextkeeper sync    →  pushes state to your GitHub bridge repo
contextkeeper bootstrap →  generates a paste-ready prompt for any AI
paste it in → full context in < 60 seconds

Works with **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, **Llama**, **Mistral**, or any LLM that can read a URL.

---

## Quickstart
```bash
cd my-project
contextkeeper init

# sync state to GitHub
contextkeeper sync

# generate bootstrap prompt and copy to clipboard
contextkeeper bootstrap -p my-project --clipboard

# paste into Claude, GPT, Gemini — full context restored instantly
```
