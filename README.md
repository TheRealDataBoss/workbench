## Universal AI Session Continuity Framework

This repo is the persistent memory layer for all active projects owned by Steven Wazlavek (@theRealDataBoss). Any AI session reads this repo at the start and has full context. No chat history needed. No zip files. No manual re-explanation.

## How To Bootstrap Any Session

Paste this into any new AI chat, replacing [project-name]:

> "Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRealDataBoss/workbench/main/BOOTSTRAP.md and continue [project-name]"

The AI fetches PROFILE.md + projects/[project]/HANDOFF.md + projects/[project]/STATE_VECTOR.json and is fully loaded in under 60 seconds.
